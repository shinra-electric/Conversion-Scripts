## CHD
The CHD file format ([Compressed Hunks of Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAME#ROM_data)) was originally created by the MAME team to handle various disc formats used by arcade machines. But due to its versatility and lossless compression, it has become popular with many emulators for consoles that used disc media storage.<br> 

A few of the emulators that support CHD files include: 

- [Duckstation](https://www.duckstation.org) (PS1)
- [PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net) (PS2)
- [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org) (PSP)

It is especially useful for PlayStation 1 games, as the ISO format is incompatible with many games that have multiple tracks.
